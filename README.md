# ML-Algorithms-Performance-comparison with Neuran networking.
Comparison of performance of Naïve Bayes, Random Forests and Support Vector Machine on the given dataset.

Finalise your choice of dataset and classification problem in a separate formative group submission in the week commencing 21st November. 
Each member of the group should choose a different classification method from:
1.	Naïve Bayes
2.	Random Forests
3.	Support Vector Machine
4.	Neural Network

Each member should train a classifier for the chosen dataset using their chosen technique and also neural networks. You should develop your neural network solutions independently. Each classifier (including neural networks) should be optimised and analysed for accuracy and training time.
